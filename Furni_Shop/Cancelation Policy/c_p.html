            <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>We want to make your shopping experience as smooth as possible. Here’s our cancellation policy:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Cancellation Before Shipping</h3>
            <p>If you cancel your order before it’s shipped, you will receive a full refund to your original payment method.</p>

            <h3>2. Cancellation After Shipping</h3>
            <p>If your order has already been shipped, you can still cancel it by contacting our customer support, but you may be responsible for return shipping fees.</p>

            <h3>3. Non-Cancellable Items</h3>
            <p>Some items, like custom or made-to-order furniture, cannot be cancelled once the order is placed. Check the product description for more information.</p>

            <h3>4. How to Cancel</h3>
            <p>To cancel your order, please contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@furnitureshop.com">support@furnitureshop.com</a> or call us at (123) 456-7890.</p>
